## 1
JSON:API is a specification for how a client should request that resources be fetched or modified, and how a server should respond to those requests.
It is designed to minimize both the number of requests and the amount of data transmitted between clients and server. Itâ€™s efficient and meanwhile not compromising readability, flexibiliy or discoverability.

## 2
Alternatives to JSON:API includes: RESTful API and GraphQL.

### Pros:
1. excellent request efficiency. A single request sufficient for most needs.<br/>
2.operations are simple. works out of the box with CDNs and reverse proxies. no client-side libraries needed.<br/>
3. also excellent in terms of writing data. how writes are handled is clearly defined by the specs.

### Cons: 
1. Documentation is limited and schemas are limited to only generic schema. reliable field-level shcema is not yet available.<br/>
2. Interactivity is limited. Developers need to ovserve available fields and links in its reponses to enable the exploration of API, which is less ideal compared to GraphQL.
